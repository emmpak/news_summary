The former Lib DEm MP, Julian Huppert, is contesting the seat again. Cambridge has the second highest number of 18-25 year-old voters in the country, after Oxford. </p> <p>The Lib Dems are pinning their hopes that strong feelings about Brexit, in the city where 73% voted remain, will trump past grievances about the coalition. “You have two people here, myself and Julian Huppert, who voted against the rise in fees,” he said, speaking at the Hundred Houses regeneration site in the northeast of the town.</p> <p>“It is also important to remember it is young people’s futures we are talking about here, 73% of the youngest voters voted to remain. </p> <p>“This is about what happens in the next 40 or 50 years for our country and at the moment Britain is heading off a cliff-edge towards a very, very hard Brexit without a route to remain, except through the Lib Dems.”</p> <p>Farron said the party had a clear offering to students and young people which was a “way out” of Brexit. “You know the stick I get at PMQs for saying firmly that there has got to be an alternative to this,” he said. “There has to be some hope, some route, for people who think Britaon should be better than this. Which party is offering you some genuine hope, a way out of all this? <br /></p> <p>“The Labour party are neither fish nor fowl on the biggest issue in generations which will affect them much longer than most people.

He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The situation in North Korea has changed very substantially over the last few years. What people thought was an almost comical question - the North Korean nuclear threat - has become very real and very dangerous indeed.</p> <p>We need to address it. I think the White House are entirely right in escalating the seriousness of this question. All North Korea’s neighbours feel this threat very intensely. </p> <p>To what extent is there a military solution? I have to say I am very, very sceptical and so are most of the experts that I’ve talked to. </p> <p>I think the military options are not good. The best way forward - and I think this is what the White House wants to pursue - is to keep a calm, clear head and to work particularly with Beijing to try to bring pressure on Pyongyang, try to get them to see that they could have a great economic future if they could agree not to be so threatening, if they could agree a freeze or to denuclearise. That’s got to be the way forward, but as people can see, at the moment the situation is tense.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if British troops could be involved in any allied military action, Johnson said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All the evidence I have seen suggests to me that the military options are very far from good. Don’t forget that Seoul - the capital of South Korea - is only about 40 minutes from the border with North Korea. </p> <p>The risk of huge, hideous reprisals against South Korea as a result of any kind of attack on North Korea has got to be very, very severe ...</p> <p>Military action against North Korea, in my honest opinion, is not a good idea at the moment and I certainly don’t think it’s likely.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He defended the Vote Leave claim that leaving the EU would save the UK £350m a week. </strong>He claimed the figure was “not disputed”. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/may/23/does-the-eu-really-cost-the-uk-350m-a-week\">(But it was, because it is not true.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He refused to commit to saying annual net migration should be cut to below 100,000.</strong> When pressed on this, he said immigration was too high but he refused to back the 100,000 target, which the government is officially committed to despite most experts viewing it as highly unrealistic.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said Britain would stop paying “huge sums of money in the long term” to Europe after Brexit.</strong> Theresa May and other ministers have said before that after Brexit the UK will not pay “huge sums” to the EU, but Johnson’s reference to “in the long term” could be a tacit admission that the Brexit deal will involve the UK paying a huge sum to the EU in the short term.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He played down the significance of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4449780/US-Commerce-Secretary-says-UK-trade-deal-low-priority.html\">comments from Wilbur Ross, the US commerce secretary, suggesting a UK-US trade deal is not a top priority for Washington.</a> </strong>He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Everybody, from the White House down, has been telling us in the last few months they regard the opportunities provided by a free trade deal with the UK as extremely exciting. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He admitted that the UK would not be able to conclude trade deals with other countries within the next two years, while it remains a member of the EU. </strong>But he said that the government would be able to prepare for these deals. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said the UK would not be willing to pay a Brexit divorce bill to the EU before substantive negotiations on a trade deal start.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you’re saying that they want the money before they get any substantive talks then that is obviously not going to happen.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the Germans blocked a deal before Christmas on the rights of EU nationals living in the UK and the rights of Britons living on the continent.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>As Theresa May has said, this is a priority for us, we want to guarantee their rights, to give them the maximum possible stability and security. Alas, we made an offer by the way before Christmas that we would do a deal in advance of the negotiations, that was turned down you may recall by Germany, we’re left in a position where we have to do a reciprocal deal, and we’re fine with that. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the election of Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister would be a threat to Britain.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I do think there is a slight risk that people won’t detect the threat that is hidden behind this sort of Islingtonian herbivorous.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said there was a “real risk” if the government was led by someone who has been “hostile to Nato” and who would disarm Britain’s nuclear weapons.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don’t think [who becomes prime minister is] the real issue in this campaign. I think the real issue is blank cheque.

That’s why our currency is down 15% ...</p> <p>What the Tories have done very cleverly is give people the national interest reason for voting Tory.</p> <p>What they’ve said is, the patriotic thing irrespective of your politics is to vote Conservative because she needs a strong hand in the negotiation, which is a very persuasive argument, until you realise that she’s tied her hands in the negotiation, the prime minister, by saying I’m not going to put the single market on the table.</p> <p>People have really got to understand the difference between the single market and a free trade agreement.

The comics historian Denis Gifford has called him “the most influential and most imitated comics artist of modern times” and he was inducted into the British Comic Awards Hall of Fame in 2013. Baxendale died from cancer on Tuesday.</p> <p>Andy Fanton, who currently writes Beano strips for Baxendale’s creations Little Plum, the Bash Street Kids and now Minnie the Minx, called him “the godfather of so much of what we do”.</p> <p>“It’s no understatement to say that I literally wouldn’t be where I am now if it wasn’t for Leo,” Fanton said. “His influence runs beyond that though. I became aware of his work as a kid when I got my hands on older Beano books and read some of those early strips – his anarchic, riotous style was so distinctive and had so often been emulated or adapted by others who came after him that it still felt completely fresh … Legendary is a word bandied about quite liberally these days, but Leo definitely was legendary, and long may his legacy last!”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd661a4d17df9769accbdc4ca04124b621ab2d47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd661a4d17df9769accbdc4ca04124b621ab2d47/0_0_1321_471/1000.png\" alt=\"Minnie the Minx\" width=\"1000\" height=\"357\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘This’ll fix ’em!’ ... Minnie the Minx in the Beano</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: (c) DC Thomson &amp; Co Ltd 2017</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to the comic writer Alan Moore, who read his work in the Beano as a child, Baxendale was the reason British comics creators made waves in America during the 1980s. “We started out ingesting the genuine anarchy of the Beano, when Baxendale was doing all that wonderful stuff, and then we moved on to American comics,” <a href=\"http://www.paulgravett.com/articles/article/leo_baxendale\">he told journalist Paul Gravett in 2013</a>. “We just became fascinated with all that gaudy exotica.”</p> <p>Born in 1930 in the small village of Whittle-le-Woods near Chorley in Lancashire, Baxendale encountered the Beano’s 1938 first edition in the playground, but was distinctly underwhelmed. “The comics I read at the time were above my age,” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jul/30/booksforchildrenandteenagers.shopping\">he recalled in the Guardian</a>, “and I was disconcerted by a comic with an ostrich on the cover.”</p> <p>He began reading the Beano during the second world war and when he returned from the Royal Air Force, he found work drawing adverts and cartoons for the Lancashire Evening Post.</p> <p>After reading a Dennis the Menace strip, Baxendale submitted a portfolio to the Beano and in 1953 began working for the comic, run by Dundee-based publisher DC Thomson. His editor wanted a female version of Dennis, but this had already been done, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jul/30/booksforchildrenandteenagers.shopping\">Baxendale remembered</a>, so instead he made Minnie the Minx, an impish and violent troublemaker: “Unlike a lot of the comics at the time, she didn’t have special powers, or superhuman strength – she was just a sturdy 12-year-old girl. She had will and ambition.”</p> <p>In 1956, Baxendale created the Bash Street Kids, another huge success that has run in the Beano ever since. “At one point, the editor showed me a letter from an adult reader saying that the artist doing the Bash Street Kids was a near-genius. I think he expected me to be pleased,” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jul/30/booksforchildrenandteenagers.shopping\">he recalled</a>. “But I was annoyed, actually, by the word ‘near’.”</p> <p>His tale of a plucky brave, Little Plum – Your Redskin Chum became popular for its stories of the Smellyfoot tribe and their battles with other tribes and bears – so popular that Baxendale’s bears got their own strip in 1959, called the Three Bears. By this point, the Beano was selling 2m copies a week.</p> <p>In 1962, overwhelmed by deadlines, Baxendale “just blew up like an old boiler, and walked out”. He left the Beano and found work two years later with Wham! and Smash! comics in London. During the 1960s, he also produced activist newsletter the Strategic Commentary, campaigning against the US’s involvement in the Vietnam war; he later revealed his first paid subscriber was Noam Chomsky.</p> <p>Baxendale fought a seven-year legal battle with DC Thomson in the 1980s for the rights to his Beano creations, which was eventually settled out of court. He never regained copyright, but was legally identified as their creator and received 30 pages of his original artwork. He later estimated he had produced 5,000-6,000 pages for the publisher.</p> <p>In 1987, Baxendale founded the publishing house Reaper Books and continued to work in comics, writing the I Love You Baby Basil! comic strip for the Guardian for a year before he retired in 1992 to focus on publishing books.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cbdafcd5257f6a8a11bb948a5210522a6134f08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cbdafcd5257f6a8a11bb948a5210522a6134f08/287_123_1175_644/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Detail from I Love You Baby Basil! cartoon by Leo Baxendale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"548\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Detail from I Love You Baby Basil! cartoon by Leo Baxendale, Guardian Weekend, 1991</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Leo Baxendale</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His eldest son Martin, who also works as a cartoonist, said Baxendale was “an impossible act to follow”.</p> <p>“His drawings were always both very, very funny and sublimely well drawn,” he added. “Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel ceiling to my greetings card and gift-book scribbles.

Others have been forced to pay £1,000-plus fees to their freeholder for permission to build an extension, while attempts to buy out the leasehold have been met with demands of £35,000 or more, even though the lease has, in some cases, hundreds of years to run. </p> <p>Sebastian O’Kelly, of the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, said: “Homebuyers wanted homes and trusted a plc housebuilder. Taylor Wimpey created an investment asset class – the freehold – which it then traded to anonymous and murky investors, who hide their beneficial ownership behind nominee directors.</p> <p>“This ground rent racket is wealth erosion on a massive scale, which has fallen mainly on young first time buyers and their families. It has revealed the rotten core of leasehold as a form of property tenure.”</p> <p>But questions remain over who will benefit from the £130m put aside by Taylor Wimpey, and whether other developers will also compensate leasehold buyers. </p> <p>Graham Balchin, a solicitor who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/nov/19/new-build-ground-rent-scandal-legal-battles-solicitors-negligence\">acted on behalf of many home buyers</a> trapped in escalating ground rents, said: “There can be no doubt that the Guardian’s series of articles has played a big part in generating the publicity which has in turn resulted in this change. </p> <p>“While this development will come as an enormous relief for those leaseholders who bought new from Taylor Wimpey, many of these properties have changed hands since they were first sold and its statement indicates that it is only those who bought direct from Taylor Wimpey that will be helped. </p> <p>“If that is a correct understanding of TW’s position it will mean that there will still be thousands of TW leaseholders who will not be helped.

Tottenham are primed to say farewell to White Hart Lane at the end of the season, or at least that remains the plan. The club will confirm before Sunday whether they are to take up the option of using Wembley as a temporary home next season while work is completed on their new stadium, which is being built on the current White Hart Lane site.</p> <p>There has not been a grand countdown to the closure of the Lane, where Tottenham have played since 1899 – certainly nothing, for example, to rival the long kiss goodnight that West Ham United gave to Upton Park last season. This has been partly down to the fact that at no point have the club said that they will for sure leave their old home at the end of the season. Moreover, they will not leave the area on the permanent basis. They will not even leave the existing footprint.</p> <p>But the emotions are swirling among the supporters and, right on cue, it is Arsenal who will visit on Sunday for what should to be the stadium’s final north London derby and second-last fixture. Tottenham entertain Manchester United on Sunday 14 May.</p> <p>Pochettino’s mind will go back to the final derby at Sarrià, when a Barcelona team under the charge of Sir Bobby Robson had looked to inflict more misery on their neighbours. Barcelona had not lost to Espanyol in 10 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37846f3ccf0366c729830df0f6cd824e11f7e964\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37846f3ccf0366c729830df0f6cd824e11f7e964/0_6_1101_660/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mauricio Pochettino, right, during his time at Espanyol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mauricio Pochettino, right, during his time at Espanyol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neal Simpson/Empics Sport</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Robson’s lineup had featured Ronaldo (the Brazilian one), Luís Figo, Pep Guardiola and Luis Enrique and, alongside Robson in the dugout, was the assistant manager, José Mourinho. But, riding a wave of emotion, Espanyol would triumph 2-0, with the Romania striker and West Ham flop Florin Raducioiu scoring the goals.</p> <p>Both were penalties, the first having been awarded early on when the Barcelona defender Fernando Couto leaned into a challenge on Pochettino and levered the ball away from him with an arm. It was a controversial decision and the Barcelona players went crackers, with Figo and Guardiola booked for their role in the mass protest to the referee.</p> <p>The touchpaper had been lit. Figo was sent off midway through the first half for a shove on Sebastián Herrera, who went down easily, and, towards the end, there was something thrown from the crowd at the Barcelona substitute Giovanni. Luis Enrique would floor a jeering Espanyol fan on his way out of the ground and Pochettino was reminded recently of how he had charged into a tackle on Ronaldo, taking the ball but clearly hoping to clean out his man as well. Ronaldo got himself out of the way.</p> <p>Espanyol fed off the passion of the crowd at Sarrià throughout the campaign and, although they would finish 12th in La Liga, only five clubs won more home matches. Pochettino has sensed something similar this season. His Tottenham team have been determined to wring every last drop out of White Hart Lane and they go into the Arsenal game on a run of 15 consecutive wins in all competitions at the stadium.</p> <p>“It’s a special season for us at White Hart Lane – we can all feel it,” Pochettino says. “It’s very special every time we play. The fans are more open to help the team and the team is more focused, trying to repay the support of the fans. It’s a moment in which we feel very comfortable at the stadium and you start to miss it before you leave. Every time you are there, you start to miss it.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eae58d7cca7e9e21db2e319fc40d95d787425fb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eae58d7cca7e9e21db2e319fc40d95d787425fb4/0_0_4480_2950/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mauricio Pochettino\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mauricio Pochettino says: It’s a special season for us at White Hart Lane – we can all feel it.

Some of them took patches of the turf, which they attempted to keep alive at home. They could not bear to say goodbye and there was the feeling that they had been let down by the club’s owners and the local government which, in their eyes, tended to be more helpful to Barça.</p> <p>Espanyol would move into the vacant Olympic Stadium and they spent 12 seasons there, enjoying great success; twice, they won the Copa del Rey. But it simply was not a football stadium and they could not wait to leave. In 2009 they got a home of their own – the new-build Cornellà-El Prat, which has since been renamed as the RCDE Stadium.</p> <p>“The last season at Sarrià was very emotional, with a big history,” Pochettino says. “As a player, I felt how emotional it was – the last game against Valencia; the day that the stand came down; how the people cried. It was very, very emotional. And now it’s happening at White Hart Lane. Many, many years later, I am living and feeling the same.”</p> <p>Whenever Arsenal visit White Hart Lane, the atmosphere is frenzied but this time, it stands to reach the next level. The expected confirmation of the stadium’s imminent demolition will give the occasion an acute significance. All of a sudden, Tottenham really do seem set to say farewell. Buckle up. Like Pochettino’s Espanyol, they intend to go with a bang.</p>"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"business/2017/apr/27/qantas-direct-uk-australia-flights-london-perth-launch","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-27T11:07:29Z","webTitle":"Qantas offers first ever direct UK to Australia flights from £1,135","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/27/qantas-direct-uk-australia-flights-london-perth-launch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/apr/27/qantas-direct-uk-australia-flights-london-perth-launch","fields":{"body":"<p>Tickets for the first non-stop flight from the UK to Australia went on sale on Thursday as Qantas launched a direct flight between London and Perth.</p> <p>Daily flights on Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner aircraft will take off on the new route from 24 March 2018, with return fares starting at £1,315 or A$2,270.</p> <p>The airline said it was the next stage in the evolution of the so-called “kangaroo route”, facilitated by the more fuel-efficient Dreamliner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/27/united-airlines-to-offer-up-to-10000-for-passengers-to-give-up-seats-on-flights\">United Airlines to offer $10,000 for passengers to give up seats</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The direct Perth flight will take 17 hours to carry passengers 9,000 miles, a far cry from the four days and seven stops it took when Qantas created the route to London in 1947. </p> <p>“We’ve said the Qantas Dreamliner is a game changer, and that’s becoming real today,” said Alan Joyce, the chief executive of the Australian airline.</p> <p>“The kangaroo route has kept changing with new technology.

Just not a lot there.</p> <p>No one doubted Margaret Thatcher’s formidable brain, nor her political astuteness and agility. She talked iron lady not-for-turning, but she ducked and dived when she faced immutable evidence she was on a dangerous tack. Until the mad hubris of power overwhelmed her, as it does most long-time leaders, she had the wit to pick her battles.</p> <p>But what if May starts out brimming with hubris and inflexible obstinacy? “Strong and stable” may be nothing more than rigid, blinkered and narrow-minded.</p> <p>So far she hasn’t done much for us to judge her on, though her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/17/theresa-may-brexit-speech-prime-minister-britain\" title=\"\">dogmatic approach to all things Brexit</a> make us fear the worst.

As with David Cameron, the Tories find warm words easily taken at face value by many voters.</p> <p>However, this week one stand-out policy opens a window into her soul. On Wednesday, in rapid “wash-up” negotiations between parties on which current bills can pass before parliament shuts down, there was optimism that a sensible Lords amendment would be accepted by the government in the higher education and research bill. Lord Hannay, former UN ambassador, proposed removing foreign students from the overall count as “immigrants” and that passed in the Lords by a large majority, only one peer speaking against.</p> <p>This blindingly obvious good sense was supported by many in government: besides it would help meet the fruitless and failed immigration target. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, made the case, as did both Johnson brothers, Boris foreign secretary and Jo, universities minister, among many ministers wanting to grow not shrink numbers of foreign students. Former Tory minister Lord Patten, chancellor of Oxford University, called the government’s stance “crazy”, Labour’s Baroness Royall called it a “no-brainer”. But the word came down from Downing Street: Theresa May will not hear of it. No, no, no.</p> <p>Since 2010 May’s Home Office has tightened the tourniquet on student visas. The number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/dec/12/uk-halve-international-student-visa-tougher-rules\" title=\"\">Indians studying here has halved</a> and they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jan/04/anxious-international-students-turn-away-from-uk\" title=\"\">turned instead</a> to benefit the US, Canada and Australia.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/jul/17/top-20-countries-international-students\" title=\"\">In 2014 the UK was the second most popular destination for international students</a>, after the US. Around 427,000 were studying in the UK, 19% of all UK undergraduates and more postgraduates – bringing in a substantial income for universities.

If soft power is our strength, educating the world is our great ambassador. India, as a prime target for a new trade deal, will demand more visas in exchange, especially for students.

A <a href=\"http://www.comresglobal.com/polls/universities-uk-international-students-poll/\" title=\"\">ComRes poll shows only 24% of people regard foreign students as immigrants</a> and 70% think they should be allowed to stay and use their skills working here after graduating. Resentment of immigrants tends to focus on uneducated, non-English speakers.</p> <p>This is a character question: her “no means no” means blocking her ears to common sense. She is not a “strong and stable” leader but a craven follower, if she fears she owes her prime ministership to immigration above all else. This bodes ill for her future style of decision-making.</p>"},"isHosted":false}]}}
